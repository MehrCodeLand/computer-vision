Understanding Masking in OpenCV and Image Processing
1. What is Masking in Image Processing?
Masking is a technique used to selectively process certain regions of an image. A mask is essentially a binary or grayscale image that determines which pixels of the input image should be kept, modified, or ignored. In OpenCV, masks are often used for:

Filtering: Applying operations only to selected areas.
Object Segmentation: Extracting specific objects from an image.
Feature Detection: Focusing on regions of interest (ROI).
Blending & Inpainting: Selecting areas for processing like blurring, sharpening, or filling missing parts.
